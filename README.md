### Abstract
Foliar endophytes play crucial roles in large-scale ecosystem functions through their impacts on plant productivity, decomposition, and nutrient cycling. The possible effects of environmental nutrient supply on the growth and carbon use of endophytic microbes have critical implications for these processes. However, the impacts of soil nutrient supply on foliar endophytic community composition and function are not fully understood. Here, we examined the effects of long-term elevated supply of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients (NPKμ) on the taxonomic composition and carbon use phenotypes of bacterial and fungal foliar endophytes inhabiting the prairie grass Andropogon gerardii. We hypothesized that elevated soil nutrients (i) alter both taxonomic composition and carbon use profiles of foliar endophytes, and (ii) significantly shift niche overlap (a proxy for potential resource competition) among microbes within leaves. We observed slight changes in taxonomic composition and carbon use patterns of fungal, but not bacterial, endophytes of A. gerardii growing at high nutrient supply (NPKμ-amendment) versus ambient conditions. Fungal endophytes from plants experiencing NPKμ-amendment had significantly smaller niche widths and distinct carbon use profiles compared to those from control plots and demonstrated greater specialization across carbon sources. Niche overlap between bacterial and fungal endophytes increased with plot nutrient supply, suggesting increased potential for inter-kingdom resource competition. Collectively, this work shows that soil nutrient enrichment alters the composition and functional phenotypes of foliar fungal endophyte communities and substantially increases the potential for inter-kingdom resource competition among culturable bacterial and fungal endophytes.
